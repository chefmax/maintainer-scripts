This repo contains a bunch of scripts which can be useful
for typical toolchain maintenance tasks:
* build compiler (gcc-build and llvm-build)
* test a change (gcc-bootstrap-and-regtest)
* compare ChangeLogs of 2 OSS projects (gnu-compare-projects)
* compare 2 sets of Dejagnu reports (deja-compare-checks, gcc-compare-checks)
* configure, build and install a typical Autoconf project (configure-build-install)
* set up ctags for gcc source dir (gcc-index)
* run compiler proper under debugger (gcc-debug)

All the code is MIT-licensed.
